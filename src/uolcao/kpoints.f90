   integer :: kPointStyleCode ! In all cases the kpoint information is read
         !   from a separate file than the olcao.dat file. This separates the
         !   atomic description (basis and potential) in the olcao.dat file
         !   and the kpoint mesh in a separate file. The code value in that
         !   file will cause the kpoints to be set up in different ways.
         !   If 0 then the kpoints will be read as an explicit list.
         !   If 1 then the kpoints will be read as a mesh definition along
         !      with a specific shift.
         !   If 2 then the kpoints will be read as a minimum density that
         !      will be applied along each axis. Additionally a specific
         !      shift is also read in.
   integer :: kPointIntgCode ! For each kpoint mesh it may be possible to use
         !   a variety of different integration methods from simple histograms
         !   to linear analytic tetrahedron (LAT) integration, etc. There are
         !   some constraints to be aware of. If the kpoints are given in the
         !   form of a regular grid (not necessarily square) then any LAT
         !   method can be used. A regular grid will certainly be present for
         !   kPointStyleCode values of 1 and 2, but for kPointStyleCode 0 it
         !   is possible that the mesh will not be regular. It is the
         !   responsibilty of the user to know whether or not a LAT method can
         !   be used if they provide the kPoints as an explicit list with
         !   kPointStyleCode 0.
         !   If 0 then the histogram method will be used.
         !   If 1 then LAT as described in will be used.
         !   If 2 then LAT as described in will be used.
         !   If 3 then LAT as described in will be used.
   integer :: numKPoints ! The number of kpoints in the system.
   integer :: numPaths ! The number of discontinuous high-sym. KP paths.
   integer :: numPathKP ! Number of kpoints that will be used to create the
         !   path between the high symmetry kpoints.
   integer :: isCartesian ! 1 = yes, 0 = no (Are the high symmetry kpoints
         !   given in cartesian coordinates?)
   integer :: numTotalHighSymKP ! Total number of high symmetry kpoints over
         !   all paths.
   integer, dimension (dim3) :: numAxialKPoints ! Number of kpoints along each
         !   of the a, b, c axes defining the kpoint mesh. This is only used
         !   if the kPointStyleCode equals 1 or 2.
   integer, allocatable, dimension (:) :: numHighSymKP ! Number of high
         !   symmetry kpoints that define the vertices of each path to be taken
         !   for the band diagram.
   real (kind=double) :: minKPointDensity ! The number of kpoints along each
         !   a,b,c axis divided by the magnitude of that axis must be greater
         !   than or equal to the value of minKPointDensity. This is only used
         !   if the kPointStyleCode equals 2.
   real (kind=double), dimension (dim3) :: kPointShift ! Fractional amount to
         !   shift the kpoint mesh by along each of the a,b,c axes. This is
         !   only used if the kPointStyleCode equals 1 or 2.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:) :: kPointWeight ! The
         !   weight assigned to each kpoint.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: kPoints ! The acutal
         !   kpoints.  The first dimension holds the three cartesian xyz
         !   coordinates.  The second dimension is the index over the number
         !   of kpoints.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:,:) :: highSymKP ! These
         !   are the high symmetry kpoints of the requested path.  The first
         !   dimension holds the three space coordinates of the kpoints
         !   to be indexed by the second dimension (numHighSymKP). The last
         !   dimension indexes which discrete path these points define.
   real (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:) :: pathKPointMag ! Distance
         !   magnitudes of kpoints on the path for band diagrams.
   complex (kind=double), allocatable, dimension (:,:) :: phaseFactor ! The

   ! The list of kpoints is structured as a regular mesh that matches the
   !   reciprocal space lattice (angles and magnitudes). The distances between
   !   kpoints along each a, b, c axis may be different, but, along any given
   !   axis the distances are constant. One could envision the mesh as a set of
   !   exactly equal parallelepipeds that are stacked to form the reciprocal
   !   space cell. The corners (vertices) of the parallelepipeds are the set
   !   of kpoints.

   ! From that set of kpoints we must generate tetrahedra. The tricky thing is
   !   that the kpoints are generated using three nested loops so that indexing
   !   the vertices of a given parallelepiped requires careful counting of
   !   the position in the one dimensional the kpoint array.

   !   looping through a, b, c axis steps (in that order). In other words the
