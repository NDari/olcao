# Matrices are printed in the order in which they are provided in the
#   matrix_list array. Each matrix is handled according to whatever special
#   requirements that the matrix may have associated with its icode value.
#   The icode value is the first element in the meta data associated with
#   each matrix. As a note, the second meta data element is the number of
#   terms that the matrix has (i.e., one or three (xyz) usually). The third
#   meta data element is the tag that should be appended to variable names.
# The matrix_meta contains:
#   [0] = icode
#   [1] = num terms (usually 1 or 3 (for xyz))
#   [2] = tag string (usually "_ol" or "_ke")
# icode = 1: Overlap matrix
# icode = 2: Kinetic energy matrix
# icode = 3: Three-center overlap matrix (electronic potential)
# icode = 4: Nuclear potential
# icode = 5: Mass velocity
# icode = 6: Momentum matrix
# icode = 7: Dipole moment
# icode = 8: Derivative of the kinetic energy
# icode = 9: Derivative of the electronic potential
# icode = 10: Derivative of the nuclear potential.

    #   happening to reduce confusion. I'm sure that this could be written
    #   in a better way, but until I have a bit more time to create such
    #   an algorithm this one will have to do.
    # There are three stages to the algorithm.
    # (1) First, we initialize a list of the needed pc terms to include
    #   all the terms from the m=0 (first) level.
    # (2) Then, we search through that linear list and examine each of the
    #   matrix element expressions associated with the members in the list.
    #   The examination consists of creating possible additional terms
    #   and then attempting to find those terms in the text of the needed_pc
    #   matrix element expressions. If a match is found and the search term
    #   is not already in the list of needed_pcs then we add it to the list.
    #   Note: A trick is that we iterate in a while loop along a linear
    #   list. We are searching a list from some start to an end and when
    #   we reach the end we reset the start and end points of the search
    #   (because the list might have grown). Once the list does not grow
    #   any more (because we've found all the necessary terms) then we can
    #   quit the loop.
    # (3) Finally, we traverse the list of needed_pc in a funny order. In
    #   each m level we must traverse from lower to higher, but we need to
    #   start with the highest m level going down to the lowest m level.
    #   Hence, we will reverse the m=0 list and each other m level list as
    #   it is added. Then the full list will be reverse before printing.
    #   This is because the higher m terms need to be known to compute many of
    #   the lower m terms, but within one m level many of the lower terms
    #   need to be known to compute higher terms in the same m level.

    # Construct a list of only the terms that are needed from each m level.
    #   This is a bit of a funny algorithm so I'll try to explain what is
    #   happening to reduce confusion. I'm sure that this could be written
    #   in a better way, but until I have a bit more time to create such
    #   an algorithm this one will have to do.
    # (1) First, we initialize a list of the needed pc terms to include
    #   all the terms from the m=0 (first) level. I.e., every single
    #   integral at the m=0 level is required. Therefore, we add every
    #   single m=0 term to the needed_pc list.
    # (2) Then, we search through that linear list and examine each of the
    #   matrix element expressions associated with the members in the list.
    #   The examination consists of creating possible additional terms (of
    #   higher m value than each of the current needed_pc integral terms)
    #   and then attempting to find those terms in the text of the needed_pc
    #   matrix element expressions. If a match is found and the search term
    #   is not already in the list of needed_pcs then we add it to the list.
    #   Note: A trick is that we iterate in a while loop along a linear
    #   list. We are searching a list from some start to an end and when
    #   we reach the end we reset the start and end points of the search
    #   (because the list might have grown). Once the list does not grow
    #   any more (because we've found all the necessary terms) then we can
    #   quit the loop.
    # (3) Then, we traverse the list of needed_pc in a funny order. In
    #   each m level we must traverse from lower to higher, but we need to
    #   start with the highest m level going down to the lowest m level.
    #   Hence, we will reverse the m=0 list and each other m level list as
    #   it is added. Then, the full list will be reversed before printing.
    #   This is because the higher m terms need to be known to compute many of
    #   the lower m terms, but within one m level many of the lower terms
    #   need to be known to compute higher terms in the same m level.
    # (4) Additionally, there are cases where the regular nuclear calculation
    #   results are used to compute the solutions for another (related)
    #   integral (e.g., for force calculations). In that case, we also search
    #   the terms in the other matrix to see if any terms in the nuclear
    #   matrix are required.
