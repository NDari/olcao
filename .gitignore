# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
bin/

# Ignore directories that will contain install databases, binaries, and jobs
/share
/bin
/jobs

# Ignore directories that will contain compiled object files
/build/debug/*
/build/release/*

# Ignore any __pycache__ files (in the .olcao directory).
__pycache__

# ignore the external folder. This is a uniform place to put all the
# things external to OLCAO but are meant to be used with olcao.
/external
/external/*
